# Melanoma detection
> Building a model to detect melanoma skin disease.


## General Information
- This model enables to detect the skin disease type a person is suffering with, so that early treatment cane provided by dermatologists.
- Train and Test data sets of the images of the types of skin diseases with 9 classes is used.

## Conclusions
- adding class rebalance reduce overfitting to some extent.
- but the accuracy dropped after normalisation.
- after augmentation as well overfitting decreased with low accuracy.

## Technologies Used
- python library
- augmenter 
- Tensorflow Keras library
